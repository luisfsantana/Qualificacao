	Abstract = {{Today, it is possible to associate multiple CPUs and multiple GPUs in a single shared memory architecture. Using these resources efficiently in a seamless way is a challenging issue. In this paper, we propose a parallelization scheme for dynamically balancing work load between multiple CPUs and GPUs. Most tasks have a CPU and GPU implementation, so they can be executed on any processing unit. We rely on a two level scheduling associating a traditional task graph partitioning and a work stealing guided by processor affinity and heterogeneity. These criteria are intended to limit inefficient task migrations between GPUs, the cost of memory transfers being high, and to favor mapping small tasks on CPUs and large ones on GPUs to take advantage of heterogeneity. This scheme has been implemented to support the SOFA physics simulation engine. Experiments show that we can reach speedups of 22 with 4 GPUs and 29 with 4 CPU cores and 4 GPUs. CPUs unload GPUs from small tasks making these GPUs more efficient, leading to a "cooperative speedup" greater than the sum of the speedups separatly obtained on 4 GPUs and 4 CPUs.}},

	Abstract = {Motivation: The Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) is one of the most widely used bioinformatics tools. The widespread impact of BLAST is reflected in over 53 000 citations that this software has received in the past two decades, and the use of the word `blast' as a verb referring to biological sequence comparison. Any improvement in the execution speed of BLAST would be of great importance in the practice of bioinformatics, and facilitate coping with ever increasing sizes of biomolecular databases.Results: Using a general-purpose graphics processing unit (GPU), we have developed GPU-BLAST, an accelerated version of the popular NCBI-BLAST. The implementation is based on the source code of NCBI-BLAST, thus maintaining the same input and output interface while producing identical results. In comparison to the sequential NCBI-BLAST, the speedups achieved by GPU-BLAST range mostly between 3 and 4.Availability: The source code of GPU-BLAST is freely available at http://archimedes.cheme.cmu.edu/biosoftware.html.Contact: sahinidis@cmu.eduSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

	Abstract = {{Most recent HPC platforms have heterogeneous nodes composed of multi-core CPUs and accelerators, like GPUs. Programming such nodes is typically based on a combination of OpenMP and CUDA/OpenCL codes; scheduling relies on a static partitioning and cost model. We present the XKaapi runtime system for data-flow task programming on multi-CPU and multi-GPU architectures, which supports a data-flow task model and a locality-aware work stealing scheduler. XKaapi enables task multi-implementation on CPU or GPU and multi-level parallelism with different grain sizes. We show performance results on two dense linear algebra kernels, matrix product (GEMM) and Cholesky factorization (POTRF), to evaluate XKaapi on a heterogeneous architecture composed of two hexa-core CPUs and eight NVIDIA Fermi GPUs. Our conclusion is two-fold. First, fine grained parallelism and online scheduling achieve performance results as good as static strategies, and in most cases outperform them. This is due to an improved work stealing strategy that includes locality information; a very light implementation of the tasks in XKaapi; and an optimized search for ready tasks. Next, the multi-level parallelism on multiple CPUs and GPUs enabled by XKaapi led to a highly efficient Cholesky factorization. Using eight NVIDIA Fermi GPUs and four CPUs, we measure up to 2.43 TFlop/s on double precision matrix product and 1.79 TFlop/s on Cholesky factorization; and respectively 5.09 TFlop/s and 3.92 TFlop/s in single precision.}},

Practical-time implementations using high-end computers are reported but are accessible only to a few. Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) of today have high computation power and low price. They have a restrictive programming model and are tricky to use. The G80 line of Nvidia GPUs can be treated as a SIMD processor array using the CUDA programming model. We present a few fundamental algorithms - including breadth first search, single source shortest path, and all-pairs shortest path - using CUDA on large graphs. We can compute the single source shortest path on a 10 million vertex graph in 1.5 seconds using the Nvidia 8800GTX GPU costing $600. In some cases optimal sequential algorithm is not the fastest on the GPU architecture. GPUs have great potential as high-performance co-processors.},

	Abstract = {The research area of Multimedia Content Analysis (MMCA) considers all aspects of the automated extraction of knowledge from multimedia archives and data streams. To satisfy the increasing computational demands of MMCA problems, the use of High Performance Computing (HPC) techniques is essential. As most MMCA researchers are not HPC experts, there is an urgent need for `familiar' programming models and tools that are both easy to use and efficient.

Today, several user transparent library-based parallelization tools exist that aim to satisfy both these requirements. In general, such tools focus on data parallel execution on traditional compute clusters. As of yet, none of these tools also incorporate the use of many-core processors (e.g. GPUs), however. While traditional clusters are now being transformed into GPU-clusters, programming complexity vastly increases -- and the need for easy and efficient programming models is as urgent as ever.

This paper presents our first steps in the direction of obtaining a user transparent programming model for data parallel and hierarchical multimedia computing on GPU-clusters. The model is obtained by extending an existing user transparent parallel programming system (applicable to traditional compute clusters) with a set of CUDA compute kernels. We show our model to be capable of obtaining orders-of-magnitude speed improvements, without requiring any additional effort from the application programmer.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we propose SnuCL, an OpenCL framework for heterogeneous CPU/GPU clusters. We show that the original OpenCL semantics naturally fits to the heterogeneous cluster programming environment, and the framework achieves high performance and ease of programming. The target cluster architecture consists of a designated, single host node and many compute nodes. They are connected by an interconnection network, such as Gigabit Ethernet and InfiniBand switches. Each compute node is equipped with multicore CPUs and multiple GPUs. A set of CPU cores or each GPU becomes an OpenCL compute device. The host node executes the host program in an OpenCL application. SnuCL provides a system image running a single operating system instance for heterogeneous CPU/GPU clusters to the user. It allows the application to utilize compute devices in a compute node as if they were in the host node. No communication API, such as the MPI library, is required in the application source. SnuCL also provides collective communication extensions to OpenCL to facilitate manipulating memory objects. With SnuCL, an OpenCL application becomes portable not only between heterogeneous devices in a single node, but also between compute devices in the cluster environment. We implement SnuCL and evaluate its performance using eleven OpenCL benchmark applications.},

@conference{Flat,
	Abstract = {For leveraging multiple GPUs in a cluster system, it is necessary to assign application tasks to multiple GPUs and execute those tasks with appropriately using communication primitives to handle data transfer among GPUs. In current GPU programming models, communication primitives such as MPI functions cannot be used within GPU kernels. Instead, such functions should be used in the CPU code. Therefore, programmer must handle both GPU kernel and CPU code for data communications. This makes GPU programming and its optimization very difficult.

In this paper, we propose a programming framework named FLAT which enables programmers to use MPI functions within GPU kernels. Our framework automatically transforms MPI functions written in a GPU kernel into runtime routines executed on the CPU. The execution model and the implementation of FLAT are described, and the applicability of FLAT in terms of scalability and programmability is discussed. We also evaluate the performance of FLAT. The result shows that FLAT achieves good scalability for intended applications.},

This GPU version is developed based on a CPU DFT-PWP code: PEtot, which can calculate up to a thousand atoms on thousands of processors. Our test indicates that the GPU version can have a ~10 times speed-up over the CPU version. A detail analysis of the speed-up and the scaling on the number of CPU/GPU computing units (up to 256) are presented. The success of our speed-up relies on the adoption a hybrid reciprocal-space and band-index parallelization scheme. As far as we know, this is the first GPU DFT-PWP code scalable to large number of CPU/GPU computing units. We also outlined the future work, and what is needed to further increase the computational speed by another factor of 10.},

	Abstract = {Rapid advances in the performance and programmability of graphics accelerators have made GPU computing a compelling solution for a wide variety of application domains. However, the increased complexity as a result of architectural heterogeneity and imbalances in hardware resources poses significant programming challenges in harnessing the performance advantages of GPU accelerated parallel systems. Moreover, the speedup derived from GPU often gets offset by longer communication latencies and inefficient task scheduling. To achieve the best possible performance, a suitable parallel programming model is therefore essential.

In this paper, we explore a new hybrid parallel programming model that incorporates GPU acceleration with the Partitioned Global Address Space (PGAS) programming paradigm. As we demonstrate, by combining Unified Parallel C (UPC) and CUDA as a case study, this hybrid model offers programmers with both enhanced programmability and powerful heterogeneous execution. Two application benchmarks, namely NAS Parallel Benchmark (NPB) FT and MG, are used to show the effectiveness of our proposed hybrid approach. Experimental results indicate that both implementations achieve significantly better performance due to optimization opportunities offered by the hybrid model, such as the funneled execution mode and fine-grained overlapping of communication and computation.},

Due to the frequent changes in GPU architecture, many clusters contain heterogeneous types of GPUs, leading to the problem of load distribution among the machines. In this work, we propose a load distribution algorithm for scientific applications executed in heterogeneous GPU clusters. The algorithm finds a distribution of data that minimizes the execution time of the application, by guaranteeing that all GPUs spend the same amount of time processing its assigned kernels and data. We use the algorithm to execute the simulation of large scale neuronal networks. We show that the algorithm effectively balances the load among the GPUs and reduces the execution time of the application.},

The programming techniques currently employed on these GPUs are not sufficient to address problems exhibiting irregular, and unbalanced workload. The problem is exacerbated when trying to effectively exploit multiple GPUs concurrently, which are commonly available in many modern systems. In this paper, we propose a task-based dynamic load-balancing solution for single-and multi-GPU systems. The solution allows load balancing at a finer granularity than what is supported in current GPU programming APIs, such as NVIDIA's CUDA. We evaluate our approach using both micro-benchmarks and a molecular dynamics application that exhibits significant load imbalance. Experimental results with a single-GPU configuration show that our fine-grained task solution can utilize the hardware more efficiently than the CUDA scheduler for unbalanced workload. On multi-GPU systems, our solution achieves near-linear speedup, load balance, and significant performance improvement over techniques based on standard CUDA APIs.},

	Abstract = {Multicore machines equipped with accelerators are becoming increasingly popular. The TOP500-leading RoadRunner machine is probably the most famous example of a parallel computer mixing IBM Cell Broadband Engines and AMD opteron processors. Other architectures, featuring GPU accelerators, are expected to appear in the near future. To fully tap into the potential of these hybrid machines, pure offloading approaches, in which the main core of the application runs on regular processors and offloads specific parts on accelerators, are not sufficient. The real challenge is to build systems where the application would permanently spread across the entire machine, that is, where parallel tasks would be dynamically scheduled over the full set of available processing units. To face this challenge, we propose a new runtime system capable of scheduling tasks over heterogeneous, accelerator-based machines. Our system features a software virtual shared memory that provides a weak consistency model. The system keeps track of data copies within accelerator embedded-memories and features a data-prefetching engine. Such facilities, together with a database of self-tuned per-task performance models, can be used to greatly improve the quality of scheduling policies in this context. We demonstrate the relevance of our approach by benchmarking various parallel numerical kernel implementations over our runtime system. We obtain significant speedups and a very high efficiency on various typical workloads over multicore machines equipped with multiple accelerators.},
